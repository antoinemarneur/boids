## Background

The project was originally developed by Craig Reynolds to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds.
The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object.

The Boids Algorithm is composed of 3 principles:

1. **Separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
2. **Alignment**: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
3. **Cohesion**: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates

## Install

This project is only available through *git clone* for the moment.
